            <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup salted butter, softened, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>

        <p><b>Steps:</b></p>
        <p>
            <ol>1. Whisk together flour, cornstarch, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a bowl.</ol>
            <ol>2. Whisk together egg, sugar, butter, and vanilla in a separate large bowl until mixture is smooth. Whisk in half-and-half and buttermilk. Add flour mixture; stir until just combined and a few lumps remain. (Do not overmix.) Chill, covered, at least 1 hour or up to overnight.</ol>
            <ol>3. Preheat waffle iron to medium-high; lightly coat with cooking spray. Pour about 2/3 cup batter onto waffle iron. Cook until golden and crisp on edges, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a plate; keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter.</ol>
            <ol>4. Serve waffles with maple syrup, chocolate chips, and/or additional butter.</ol>
