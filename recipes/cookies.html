    <p><h4><b>Description:</b></h4></p>
    <p>Each soft and chewy chocolate-studded cookie is guaranteed to melt in your mouth, they’re that good! This is the classic go-to 
        recipe that will be a family favorite for years to come.</p>
        <p><h4><b>Ingredients:</b></h4></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar(100 g)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup brown sugar(165 g), packed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter(115 g), melted</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 2/4 cups all-purpose flour(155 g)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks(110 g)</li>
            <li>4 oz dark chocolate chunk(110 g), or your preference</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Steps:</b></p>
        <p>
            <ol>1. In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.</ol>
            <ol>2. Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.</ol>
            <ol>3. Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).</ol>
            <ol>4. Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.</ol>
            <ol>5. Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</ol>
            <ol>6. Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</ol>
            <ol>7. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.</ol>
            <ol>8. Cool completely before serving.</ol>
            <ol>9. Enjoy!</ol>
